# 🛠️R3 Toolshop

Welcome to the R3 Toolshop - this a tool born of ~~my own laziness~~ the necessity to make converting existing tables into R3 relations as painless as possible!  

### Currently you can convert from
- **Sharepoint lists**
- **SQLite files**
- **CSV files**
- **JSON**
- **or you can just start from a blank slate!**

### Other features 
- **Copy existing relations into the same or a different application**
- **Easily bulk create new users 😁**

It doesn't require any kind of installation - Just download the files and either use Go to build or run it as is.  If you don't want to install Go on your machine then you can just download the executable on it's own - it has the html embedded so you only need that file.  It should be run on the same machine as your dev installation of REI3 and is accessable via a web browser on localhost:8080.

**Note:** *All your server details are stored in your local storage on the browser and are not viewable in plain text*
