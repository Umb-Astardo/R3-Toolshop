# 🛠️R3 Toolshop

Welcome to the R3 Toolshop - this a tool born of ~~my own laziness~~ the necessity to make converting existing tables into R3 relations as painless as possible! 

REI3 is an extremely powerful, versatile, and easy to use free low code platform that you can host from the cloud or your own bare metal - I can't recommend it highly enough - [Please check out REI3 here](https://github.com/r3-team/r3) ... you'll be glad you did 😉

### Currently you can convert from
- **Sharepoint lists** (*you need to log into your Sharepoint site first - this is simply to avoid you having to authorise it on app on Sharepoint*)
- **SQLite files**
- **CSV files**
- **JSON**
- **or you can just start from a blank slate!**

### Other features 
- **Copy existing relations into the same or a different application**
- **Easily bulk create new users 😁**

R3 Toolshop doesn't require any kind of installation - Just download the files and either use Go to build or run it as is.  If you don't want to install Go on your Windows box then you can just download the .exe file on it's own - it already has the html embedded in it so you only need that file but if you want to ensure that it actually is running the html as documented here then just download r3toolshop.html and put it in the same folder.  It should be run from the command line on the same machine as your dev installation of REI3 and is accessable via a web browser on localhost:8080.

**Note:** *All your server details are stored in your local storage on the browser and are not viewable in plain text*
